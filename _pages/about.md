Hi there! I am software security researcher and a computer science enthusiast at large.
I'm a working at Quarkslab, where I handle diverse projects and drive R&D across our
teams. My core interests include product security, `firmwares` , tooling and software testing techniques like `fuzzing` or `symbolic execution` that I apply both on source code or at binary-level through reverse-engineering. As a hobby, I also have a keen interest in
`graphs`, _machine learning_ and `program synthesis`.

You can find here the various [conferences](/conferences) I gave, the [papers](/publications) I wrote and the various [projects](/projects) I worked on. More than active blog,
it is more an archive notepad to quickly access various materials I wrote or published. 

You can reach me at: dev.robin.david(at)gmail.com. Please use my [`PGP`](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x9C42907A59F80AF5) key for confidential requests. Otherwise, free to reach me on [X.com](https://twitter.com/RobinDavid1), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robin-david-17304685/) or any other social media.

    abstract={To maintain the security of information systems, deploying the proposed updates as soon as they are available is a good practice encouraged by all the computer security actors. Indeed, the exploitation of 1-day vulnerabilities (so called because a patch has been available for at least 1 day) can be devastating as EternalBlue or Shellshock have illustrated.The objective of this thesis is to propose methods and their practical application to detect if these patches are well applied at the lowest level, i.e. in the binary code. This is essential to have a reliable view of a system protection.To achieve this goal, we have established several milestones. The first one consists in an in-depth study of a typical patch, before formalizing a framework for searching for them at the scale of a complete system.We then propose the implementation of a software solution that automatically builds semantic signatures of vulnerability patches and searches for these signatures in filesystems.Finally, we test this solution in real conditions (i.e. detection of patches in images of the Android operating system) and show the relevance of our approach.},

    abstract={In this thesis, we address the problem of binary diffing, i.e. the problem of
    finding the best possible one-to-one correspondence between the functions of
    two programs in binary form. This problem is a major challenge in several
    fields of computer security since it automatically designates to an analyst the
    pieces of code that might have been previously analyzed among other programs.
    We propose a quite natural formulation of the binary diffing problem
    as a particular instance of a graph edit problem over the call graphs of the
    programs. Through this formulation, the quality of the function mapping is
    evaluated simultaneously with respect to both the function content similarity
    and the function calls consistency. We prove that this versatile formulation
    is in fact equivalent to the well studied network alignment problem, which
    enables us to leverage common optimization techniques. Following previous
    works, we propose a solving strategy based on max-product belief propagation,
    and introduce QBinDiff, a network alignment solver that outperforms other
    state-of-the-art methods in almost all instances. We finally show that our approach
    outperforms existing diffing tools, and that the matching strategy has
    more influence on the quality the solution than the measure of function similarity.},

    abstract={This doctoral work has been done in an industrial environment where the main
    activities were reverse engineering for vulnerability research and security properties
    verification on binary programs. The first part of this doctoral work focuses on the
    collection and sharing of the industrial problems when analyzing binary programs.
    Based on these issues, a binary dynamic analysis framework has been developed
    and formalized. Real examples of use are then presented, such as the detection
    of opaque predicates in branch conditions. Finally, a new automatic approach for
    deobfuscation of binary code protected by virtualization is presented combining
    features of the framework as well as those of other tools.},
